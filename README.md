# Project_SafeWalk

Made a node.js folder. I added express.js to handle post and get requests.

A firebase config is included, but has no info for security reasons, must be found from firebase store sdk.

Packages are not include, so you must run 'npm install' to install them.

A post request is set at the moment to test out posts.

A REST file is includes to test out the post and get requests.

If you want to run, use 'node index.js'.
